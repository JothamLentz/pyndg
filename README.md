# pyndg
Python classes for editing Network Notepad Diagrams
Currently working with version 8.4 diagrams.

[Network Notepad](http://www.networknotepad.com/index.shtml) is a Network Diagram creation software written by Jason Green

This is not intended to replace all features of Network Notepad, merely to streamline certain workflows.
For example you might use pyndg to add 100 devices and links to a diagram, then use the application itself to clean up the diagram.

See the examples folder for some usage examples.
